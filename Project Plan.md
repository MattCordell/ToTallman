**Known Issues Documented**:
- Estimated 66% pass rate for current v1.x implementation
- Critical bug identified in list selection (line 89 of Tallman.cs)
- Major gaps: punctuation handling, multi-word drugs, Unicode normalization

---

## Phase 3: C# Refactored Implementation (Week 3-5)

**Status**: ✅ Complete — 100% canonical pass, native tests + performance guards in place (Updated: 2026-06-16)
**Objective**: Reimplement C# with canonical algorithm as reference.

**🚨 CRITICAL GATE**: Must achieve 100% canonical test pass before Phase 4 — ✅ **MET (84/84)**

### Tasks

- [x] Create new directory structure at `/languages/csharp/`
- [x] Implement Unicode-safe algorithm
  - NFC normalization
  - Proper casefolding
  - Word boundary detection
  - Multi-word drug support (greedy longest-match lookahead)
- [x] Build-time list embedding (via the shared pipeline)
  - Shared compiler `tools/compile-lists` → `tallman-lists/compiled/lists.compiled.json`
  - Thin C# emitter `languages/csharp/tools/generate-embedded.ps1` → `EmbeddedTallmanLists.g.cs` (regenerated each build via `.csproj` pre-build)
- [x] Runtime API
  - `ToTallman(this string? input, string listId = "DEFAULT")`
- [x] Test adapter for canonical tests (Node adapter → Demo CLI; 84/84 pass)
- [x] Native C# unit tests (`ToTallman.Tests`: 102 tests, incl. data-driven canonical suite + perf guards)
- [x] Performance: multi-word lookahead bounded by per-list longest-entry word count (linear)

**Deliverables**:
- Clean v2.0.0 C# implementation ✅
- Build-time embedding script ✅
- 100% canonical test pass ✅ (84/84)
- Native C# test suite ✅ (102 tests: canonical + performance)
- Updated demo app ✅
- Migration notes (v1 → v2) — de-scoped (v1 was an unreleased prototype, no known consumers)

**Resolved (2026-06-16)**:
- Performance: lookahead now bounded by longest-entry word count (per-list cap) → linear. Verified by stopwatch tests (50k non-matching tokens ~120 ms; ~1.3 MB realistic text ~420 ms).
- Exception API: unknown list throws `TallmanException` directly; spec §6 updated to mandate a dedicated exception type per language.
- Migration notes: de-scoped (v1 unreleased prototype).

**Spec reconciled (2026-06-16)**: §12 updated (multi-word / hyphenated drugs moved out of "out-of-scope"; behaviour now documented in §3.4). §3.2/§5/§9 updated for the shared list-compilation pipeline.

---

## Phase 4: Multi-Language Implementation (Week 5-9)

**Status**: ⏸️ Ready to start (Phase 3 complete)
**Objective**: Implement in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java.

**Priority Order**: Python → JavaScript → Java (phased rollout)

**Shared list pipeline (in place 2026-06-16)**: list semantics (NFC, casefold
keys, maxWords) are centralised in `tools/compile-lists` → versioned artifact
`tallman-lists/compiled/lists.compiled.json`. Each language adds only a *thin*
emitter that formats that artifact (C# emitter at `languages/csharp/tools/`),
guaranteeing byte-identical embeddings. New languages MUST NOT re-derive keys.

### 4.1 Python Implementation (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Setup `/languages/python/` structure
- [ ] Implement algorithm using unicodedata
- [ ] Build-time embedding script
- [ ] pytest test adapter
- [ ] 100% canonical test pass
- [ ] PyPI package configuration

### 4.2 JavaScript Implementation (Week 6-7)
- [ ] Setup `/languages/js/` structure
- [ ] Implement algorithm with String.normalize
- [ ] Build-time embedding script
- [ ] Jest test adapter
- [ ] 100% canonical test pass
- [ ] npm package (CommonJS + ES modules)

### 4.3 Java Implementation (Week 7-9)
- [ ] Setup `/languages/java/` structure
- [ ] Implement algorithm with ICU4J
- [ ] Maven/Gradle build configuration
- [ ] JUnit test adapter
- [ ] 100% canonical test pass
- [ ] Maven Central package

**Deliverables**: Complete implementations for all 3 languages ❌

---

## Phase 5: CI/CD Pipeline (Week 9-10)

**Status**: ⏸️ Not Started
**Objective**: Automate validation across all languages.

### Tasks

- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflows
  - CI: Validate + test all languages
  - Release: Auto-publish on tags
- [ ] Setup pre-commit hooks
  - JSON validation
  - Code formatting
  - Linting
- [ ] Cross-language validation
- [ ] **Cross-language output parity** (carried from list-pipeline work, 2026-06-16):
  run the canonical inputs through every language implementation and assert
  byte-identical output. This is the guard for the runtime-casefold concern —
  the compiled artifact gives all languages identical keys/values, but each
  runtime must also fold input identically (current C# uses an ASCII-safe
  `ToUpperInvariant().ToLowerInvariant()` approximation; non-ASCII entries would
  need true Unicode case folding in every runtime — see spec §3.2).
- [ ] **Compiled-artifact freshness check** (carried from list-pipeline work, 2026-06-16):
  CI re-runs `tools/compile-lists` and fails if `tallman-lists/compiled/lists.compiled.json`
  differs from the committed copy, so a stale artifact (source JSON changed without
  recompiling) can't be merged.
- [ ] Status badges in README

**Deliverables**:
- GitHub Actions workflows ❌
- Pre-commit configuration ❌
- Cross-language output-parity check ❌
- Compiled-artifact freshness check ❌
- Updated README with badges ❌

---

## Phase 6: Documentation & Release (Week 10-11)

**Status**: ⏸️ Not Started
**Objective**: Prepare for public release.

### Tasks

- [ ] Update repository README
- [ ] Move spec to `/spec/TECHNICAL-SPEC.md`
- [ ] Create `MIGRATION-v1-to-v2.md`
- [ ] Create example applications for each language
- [ ] Create `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [x] Archive old implementation to `/archive/v1/`
- [ ] Finalize this Project Plan

**Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive documentation ❌
- Multi-language examples ❌
- Migration guide ❌
- Contribution guidelines ❌

## Recent Activity

### 2026-06-16
- ✅ **Phase 3 (C#) completed.**
  - Unknown-list error now throws `TallmanException` directly (generator + converter); spec §6 updated to mandate a dedicated exception type per language.
  - Fixed a latent O(n²) in the multi-word lookahead: now bounded by each list's longest-entry word count (FDA 1, NZ 3, others 2). Verified linear via stopwatch tests.
  - Added performance guards to `ToTallman.Tests` (now 102 tests). Canonical suite still 84/84.
  - Migration notes (v1 → v2) de-scoped — v1 was an unreleased prototype.
- ✅ **Centralised the list-compilation pipeline (Phase 4 enabler).**
  - New shared compiler `tools/compile-lists` does all semantics once (NFC, casefold keys, maxWords) → versioned artifact `tallman-lists/compiled/lists.compiled.json`.
  - C# refactored into a thin emitter (`languages/csharp/tools/generate-embedded.ps1`) that only formats the artifact; old `build/embed-lists.ps1` (gitignored) removed and `.csproj` pre-build repointed.
  - Behaviour-preserving: `.g.cs` changed only by header + a deterministic ordinal re-sort of two keys; tests stayed 102/102 + 84/84.
  - Spec §3.2/§5/§9 updated; defines `casefold(NFC(text))` as the canonical key and requires per-language runtimes to fold identically.

### 2026-06-15
- 🟡 **Phase 3 (C#) found to be near complete** — Project Plan was stale (had listed it as Not Started).
  - C# v2 implementation (`TallmanConverter`, `UnicodeHelpers`, `TallmanException`) builds clean; build-time list embedding working.
  - Fixed 2 bad canonical tests (test/data bugs, not code): `cefalexin` expectation in `multi-word.json`; repointed `vincristine` test from ISMP (no such entry) to FDA in `multi-list.json`.
  - Canonical suite now **84/84 (100%)** via the Node test runner.
  - Added native C# unit tests (`ToTallman.Tests`): **100 tests pass** (16 explicit + 84 data-driven canonical) — `dotnet test` now enforces the canonical gate.
  - Remaining for #12: performance project + v1→v2 migration notes; reconcile unknown-list exception type vs spec.

### 2025-11-27
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Foundation - Data Format & Validation
  - Created JSON schema with full validation rules
  - Converted all 5 lists to JSON format (775 total entries)
